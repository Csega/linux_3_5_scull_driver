SOLVED! main.c: line 557: 	.unlocked_ioctl = scull_ioctl,
	warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
	warning: (near initialization for ‘scull_fops.unlocked_ioctl’) [enabled by default]
Had to edit the scull_ioctl in the main.c and scull.h from this:
int     scull_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp,
                    unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
to this:
static long     scull_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
And THAT was a mistake. Causes the following compile time warnings/errors:

In theory, the scull_ioctl function signature change in the main.c and scull.h solved this too.

Made the tutorial at http://jayaramprabhudurairaj.com/?p=13 solved all, except the change of the scull_ioctl signature.
