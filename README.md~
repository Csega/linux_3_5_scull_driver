linux_3_5_scull_driver
======================

This is the scull driver that works with the 3.5.0 linux kernel.

The whole set of files for the Linux Device Drivers 3rd edition (http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/ for separate chapters or a single pdf file: http://www.google.hu/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=ldd3%20pdf&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDsQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffree-electrons.com%2Fdoc%2Fbooks%2Fldd3.pdf&ei=TWXCULCCFJDYsgbMkYCwAw&usg=AFQjCNFCvstFu-NyeaqJMr_54WhLo_3vuQ) can be found here:

However, these are for the 2.6.10 kernel. Right now the newest version at the Ubuntu 12.10 is the 3.5.0-19, for which the source codes there do not apply. I found a tutorial for the scull driver, that made it work on the 3.0 kernel. You can find the tutorial here:

However, it was still not fully compatible with the new 3.5.0 kernel, so I made the necessary changes (the tutorial was really helpful on the way) and made this version available.
