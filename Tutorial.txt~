You can compile the driver (under Ubuntu 12.10 - kernel 3.5.0-19) with make, since the Makefile is configured correctly.

You can load/unload the driver with the:

	sudo ./scull_load
	sudo ./scull_unload

scripts, or just use:

	sudo insmod scull.ko
	sudo rmmod scull.

You can watch the list of the loaded kernel modules with the lsmod command.

There is an init script (scull.init), which you should copy to /etc/init.d, but some distributions still place them elsewhere. In addition, if your script is to be run at boot time, you need to make a link to it from the appropriate run-level directory (i.e., .../rc3.d). Haven't tested it with the 3.5.0-19 kernel.
